Shy Cell Project

Approach

We thought about how you can adjust an environmnet depending on how many people are present in a room or place.

How can you represent that environment in a different way?

Ideas included adjusting the room to feel calmer the more people are in the room.

We landed on creating a representation of a living creature. Our shy cell.

More people make the cell shy and nervous - which means he shrinks in size, turns a different color and jumps around the screen more.

Less people means he is confident - he will grow in size, changes his color and move slower.

Using face detection to determine the amount of people seen on screen, the number of people on screen determines the characteristics of the cell.

Project Setup

1. Setting up Face detection with webcam
2. Setting up cell design and attributes
3. Connecting the input of face detection to the cell attributes (Size, Color, Speed)



Challenges

- Setting up the face detection
- Connecting the input of face detection to the cell attributes (Size, Color, Speed)
- Accuratley mapping the different number of people to the characteristics of the cell so the movements aren't jumpy or erratic
- Determining the threshold of size/color/speed for the cell
- Doing math about the movement of the cell
- Making the cell move while the computer is reading the face detection.
